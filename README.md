Title: Encryption and Decryption App

Description:
This Python application provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for text encryption and decryption using a password-based mechanism. The app is built using the Tkinter library and supports Base64 encoding and decoding for text input. Users can enter a text message in the provided text box, input a password, and then choose between encryption or decryption. The encrypted or decrypted output is displayed in a separate window.

Features:

Encryption: The app allows users to encrypt their text messages using a password. The encryption process involves converting the text to ASCII, encoding it in Base64, and displaying the result.
Decryption: Users can also decrypt previously encrypted messages using the same password. The decryption process reverses the Base64 encoding to reveal the original text.
Password Protection: A password ("1234" in the example) is required to perform encryption or decryption, adding a layer of security to the process.
Reset Functionality: The app includes a reset button to clear the password and text input fields for a new operation.
User-Friendly Interface: The graphical user interface features clear labels, text boxes, and buttons for ease of use.
